# MacBook Bridge/T2 Linux Driver
A driver for MacBook models 2018 and newer, implementing the VHCI (required for mouse/keyboard/etc.) and audio functionality.

The project is divided into 3 main components:
- BCE (Buffer Copy Engine) - this is what the files in the root directory are for. This estabilishes a basic communication channel with the T2. VHCI and Audio both require this component.
- VHCI - this is a virtual USB host controller; keyboard, mouse and other system components are provided by this component (other drivers use this host controller to provide more functionality, however USB drivers are not in this project's scope).
- Audio - a driver for the T2 audio interface, currently only audio output is supported.

Please note that the `master` branch does not currently support system suspend and resume.
